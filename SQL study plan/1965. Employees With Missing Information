# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employees.employee_id
from employees 
left join salaries on employees.employee_id = salaries.employee_id
where salaries.salary is null or employees.name is null
union
select salaries.employee_id
from salaries 
left join employees on employees.employee_id = salaries.employee_id
where salaries.salary is null or employees.name is null
order by employee_id asc;






Another solution:


select employee_id from Employees where employee_id not in (select employee_id from Salaries)
union
select employee_id from Salaries where employee_id not in (select employee_id from Employees)
order by employee_id;
